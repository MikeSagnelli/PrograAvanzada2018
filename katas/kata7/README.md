###  The Goal

Batman will look for the hostages on
 a given building by jumping from one window to another using his 
grapnel gun. Batman's goal is to jump to the window where the hostages 
are located in order to disarm the bombs. Unfortunately he has a limited
 number of jumps before the bombs go off...

###  Rules

Before each jump, the 
heat-signature device will provide Batman with the direction of the 
bombs based on Batman current position:

- U (Up)
- UR (Up-Right)
- R (Right)
- DR (Down-Right)
- D (Down)
- DL (Down-Left)
- L (Left)
- UL (Up-Left)
  

Your mission is to program the device so that **it indicates the location of the next window Batman should jump to** in order to reach the bombs' room **as soon as possible**.  
  

Buildings are represented as a rectangular array of windows, the window in the** top left corner of the building is at index (0,0)**.

###  Note

For some tests, **the bombs' location may change from one execution to the other**: the goal is to help you find the best algorithm in all cases.  
  

The tests provided are similar to the validation tests used to compute the final score but remain different.

### Synopsis

**Batman:** “_Come on Joker, give it up, I know you're hiding in here somewhere, you can't escape from me._”  
**Joker:** “_Oh, but I
 think I can Batman! Just look behind you. See these buildings over 
there? In each one of them there is a room full of hostages trapped with
 my sweet little Joker-BOMBS. They are about to go off any minute now in
 a marvellous firework! KA-BOOOM!!!_”  
**Batman:** “_Damn you Joker, you won't get away with this._”  
**Joker:** “_So what 
will it be Batman? Do you want to waste time chasing me or will you try 
to save the poor, poor hostages? I'd hurry if I were you...Ha-ha-ha_”  
**Batman:** “_Alfred, I don't have time to check all the buildings' windows: I need a gadget to help me._”  
**Alfred:** “_Certainly
 sir. I have the perfect device: it can track the bombs heat signature. 
I'm sending it to you as soon as I'm done reprogramming it._”  
**Joker:** “_So long Batman! Ha-ha-ha OH-OH-OH..._”
