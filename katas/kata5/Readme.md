# Kata 5: Infograph

Create a program that reads a long string as input and uses a word cloud where
each word's size depends on the number of times it appears in the string. 

Use a hash table for storing the words as keys and the number of times it appears 
as values.

If a word has a capital letter it should be the same as one without capital letters.
